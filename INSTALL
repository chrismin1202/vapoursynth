Installation
------------

First, a couple of things to note:

* You need to be on Windows, Linux, or OS X.
* You need to have the libraries and headers for libavutil,
  libavcodec, and libswscale installed.
* You need to have either GCC, Clang, MSVC, or ICC/ICL installed.
  Both a C and C++ compiler are required.
* You need to have Yasm installed.
* You need Python 3 for VSScript and to build the Python module.
* You need to have Cython installed in your Python 3 environment
  in order to invoke the Python wrapper setup script.
* You need Sphinx if you want to build the documentation.

First off, you'll want to fetch Waf which is the build tool
VapourSynth uses:

    $ ./bootstrap.py

You don't have to fetch it with this script; you can also
simply download it from the official Google Code repository:
http://code.google.com/p/waf

Then, configure the project:

    $ ./waf configure

The configure operation has some options which can be used to
fine-tune the build. To see a list, use:

    $ ./waf configure --help

Once the project is configured, simply execute:

    $ ./waf build

By default, Waf builds tasks in parallel. You can control the
level of parallelism with the -j option, like with Make.

If you want to build the Cython wrapper, you can do so now by
executing:

    $ ./setup.py build

Finally, to install VapourSynth:

    $ ./waf install

And to uninstall:

    $ ./waf uninstall

The install and uninstall commands accept a --destdir option
which prepends a value to the prefix given earlier in the
configure phase, in case this may be of use to you.

To install the Cython wrapper:

    $ ./setup.py install

Note that the setup script has a --prefix option like Waf.

Finally, you can run the Python tests if you have installed
the Python module:

    $ ./waf test
